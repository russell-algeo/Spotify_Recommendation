# Spotify_Recommendation

This repository contains a Spotify exploration and track recommendation tool to speed up the music discovery process for Spotify users. It also can be used to "boost" as user's playlists or identify tracks from their saved songs that would mesh will with their pre-existing playlists they are trying to bolster. It also contains files used for extraction of data from the Spotify API and calculation of rich audio features from direct audio samples of each track via Librosa. In order to use, replace Spotify API credentials in `config.py`

- `spotify_exploration_and_recommnedation.ipynb`: reads in `saved_tracks.csv` and `processed_streams.csv` as generated by `extract_saved_tracks_data.ipynb` and `extract_streaming_history_data.ipynb` to identify the user's most popular tracks, binge worthy tracks, and dependable tracks. Contains recommendation tool that allows the user to query for recommendations of single songs, recommendations of tracks that represent the "average" of two tracks, or recommendations of tracks that represent the "difference" of two tracks.
  - This file explores how we can bolster my playlist entitled "Dune Juuz", which can be found [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1ToqeObjA9M7eJxW75s3kp?si=3eed567171dc4db5)
  - Resulting recommendation playlists can be found here: 
- `spotify_playlist_boost.ipynb`: reads in playlist data from `/output/playlists` and `saved_tracks.csv` as generated in `extract_saved_tracks_data.ipynb` to recommend songs from a user's saved tracks that should be added to that user's playlists.
- `extract_saved_tracks_data.ipynb`: extracts saved tracks data (track list, Spotify API audio features, calculated rich audio features) for a user by connecting to Spotify API. Exports data as `saved_tracks.csv` to `/output`.
- `extract_streaming_history_data.ipynb`: extracts streaming history (track list, Spotify API audio features, calculated rich audio features) from .json files provided by Spotify data dump. Exports data as `processed_streams.csv` to `/output`.
- `extract_playlist_data.ipynb`: extracts playlist data (track list, Spotify API audio features, calculated rich audio features) for a user's playlist. Exports playlist data to `/output/playlists` as .csv files.
-`utils.py`: contains various utility functions used throughout other files.
- `config.py`: contains space to enter Spotify API credentials. Insert your local API credentials here for rest of repository to be able to access Spotify API for data collection.

Due to file upload size limits, I cannot directly upload the .csv files referenced above. They can be found in a [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QIBsoJ4wbtgYiuP2Yrzh1qSdOkCLcnNG?usp=sharing) where they can be downloaded.
